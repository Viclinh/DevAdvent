## Inspiration
When I was new Devpost hacker, there were many features of Devpost that I did not know and use for better hackathon experience. It took me a long time and some failures to be familiar with all the features of Devpost. Thus, there should be a guided tool that introduces all common features of Devpost to new hackers. By doing so, hackers will know:
- Where to find the rules and requirements for the hackathons 
- Where to find teammates and build groups
- Where to go to find resources to build projects for hackathons
- How to contact hackathon managers for question

In order to help new hackers on Devpost become more familiar with the site and find help for hackathons, there is a need for a walkthrough tool that can give the hackers an overview about Devpost and introduce briefly and easily different needed features of Devpost. Thus, we suggest to build an extension tool for the browser to guide users or hackers through different common features of Devpost. 

## What it does
- Make people become aware of the purpose and goal of Devpost, introduce Devpost common mission.
- Introduce common features of Devpost and types of hackathons
- Give hackers some tips and tricks when joining hackathons such as where to get resources or how to team up with other hackers
- Provide instructions about how to submit a project on Devpost.

## Benefits
- Let hackathon participants know the important role of Devpost in the hackathons
- Answer frequently asked questions of hackers in timely manner
- Save many manual hours of work for organizers who have to answer repeatedly same questions to multiple participants
- Can be used for all hackathons on Devpost. It can be introduced by organizers and Devpost as a tool that can help hackers have better hackathons experience and equip Devpost users with detailed knowledge to participate in hackathons on Devpost.
- Can generate a better positive hackathon experience for all hackathons participants.
