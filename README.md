## Inspiration
When I was new Devpost hacker, there were many features of Devpost that I did not know and use for better hackathon experience. It took me a long time and some failures to be familiar with all the features of Devpost. Thus, there should be a guided tool that introduces all common features of Devpost to new hackers. By doing so, hackers will know:
- Where to find the rules and requirements for the hackathons 
- Where to find teammates and build groups
- Where to go to find resources to build projects for hackathons
- How to contact hackathon managers for question

In order to help new hackers on Devpost become more familiar with the site and find help for hackathons, there is a need for a walkthrough tool that can give the hackers an overview about Devpost and introduce briefly and easily different needed features of Devpost. Thus, we suggest to build an extension tool for the browser to guide users or hackers through different common features of Devpost. 

## What it does
- Make people become aware of the purpose and goal of Devpost, introduce Devpost common mission.
- Introduce common features of Devpost and types of hackathons
- Give hackers some tips and tricks when joining hackathons such as where to get resources or how to team up with other hackers
- Provide instructions about how to submit a project on Devpost.

## How we built it
We built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript

## Challenges we ran into
We had challenges to think about the ideas and build the solution.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to build an extension for the idea and provide feedbacks about Devpost.

## What we learned
We learnt more about Devpost UI

## What's next for DevAgent
Improve the extension for better user experience
